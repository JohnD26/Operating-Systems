## Operating Systems
This repository contains my Operating Systems assignments, written in C and Java. These projects were a great learning experience, giving me hands-on practice with key OS concepts such as process management, memory allocation, file systems, and synchronization. I really enjoyed coding these assignments and diving deeper into how operating systems function at a low level.

Feel free to explore the code and the various solutions I implemented throughout the course!
