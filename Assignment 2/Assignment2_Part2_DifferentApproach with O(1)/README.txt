Steps to run the program:
1) Compile all files
2) Use java FibonacciGenerator n 
This will generate the Fibonacci numbers up to and including n.

Derivation of the Formula
The logic for generating Fibonacci numbers in this program is based on a derived formula for calculating Fibonacci numbers efficiently. The formula, which was derived in the PDF document, allows for efficient computation and ensures the sequence is generated correctly.

Benefits of the Derived Formula
Efficiency: The derived formula reduces the computational complexity typically associated with recursive algorithms. By using an iterative approach and leveraging the mathematical formula.The program avoids the exponential time complexity of naive recursive methods.

Accuracy: The derived formula ensures that each Fibonacci number is computed correctly and stored in the sequence array. This approach minimizes errors and ensures the integrity of the sequence.

All requirements from the assignments were met in the different approach including:
-Multithreading implementation.
-Correct generation and storage of the Fibonacci sequence.
-Proper synchronization to ensure the parent thread waits for the child thread to complete before printing the sequence.
